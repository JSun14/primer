# Directions
1. Git clone the repo in your code folder we talked about last time.
2. Run 'cd primer'
3. Then create a virtual environment. If you have mac: 'python3 -m venv primer_env'. For windows: 'virtualenv primer_env'. For linux: 'virtualenv primer_env'.
4. Now we can activate the virtual environment. Mac and Linux: 'source primer_env/bin/activate'. Windows: 'primer_env\Scripts\activate'.
5. Finally we want to install the required packages in the *requirements.txt* file. Everyone should be able to run: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
6. You can run the 'jupyter notebook' command now and it'll open up a page in your browser and you can just click open the *PythonPrimer.ipynb* file and go through that notebook and learn the material. If you want to run cells in a jupyter notebook, you can do shift + enter. It's pretty much a nice looking text editor and you can run code cell by cell rather than the entire program at once. We'll explain more in-depth about how to use these types of files later but for now play around with it and let us know of any questions. 
7. When you're done, navigate to the terminal/command prompt and hit control+c to stop the process from running. At which point you can also deactivate the virtual environment with 'deactivate'.
